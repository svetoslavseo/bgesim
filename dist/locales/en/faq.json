    "question": "What is an eSIM and what does it do?",
    "answer": "An eSIM is a virtual SIM card built into your device. It lets you access mobile networks so you can call, text, and use mobile data-just like a traditional SIM card. Instead of inserting it physically, you simply activate a plan digitally from a provider. <a href=\"/en/what-is-esim\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline\">Read more about eSIM technology</a>."
